# Dimension Coordinate Convertor

## Setup
Just like any other mod, place into your mod folder. This is a client-side mod so it's not necessary to put into the server-side mod folder.

## How to Use
While in game, press F9 to convert your current player coordinates to the corresponding translated coordinates. Ie, if you are in the overworld, it will give you the corresponding nether coordinates. And vice versa in nether. Note that this will only convert overworld to nether and nether to overworld. Custom dimensions are not supported.
Note: The block taken into account for the conversion is the block on which the player is located


## To Do 
- Add mod config page
  - Turn off mod 
  - Toggle facing direction display?
- Add custom dimension support
- The conversion of coords can be done according to a precise block (block where the player's head is, block on which the player is, block that the player fixes with his eyes)
